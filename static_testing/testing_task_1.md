### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.


```python

# Class statement: the __init__() function is missing
# It is required after the Class declaration if we want to assign values to the object properties

class CardGame:


  # The 'equals to' operator required in a conditional statement is '==" and not '='
  # A colon is required after the 'else' statement

  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False
  

  # 'dif' is not the correct keyword to declare a function ('def' is expected)
  # There should be a comma separator between parameters 'card1' and 'card2'
  # Incorrect indentation below definition: entire conditional statement should be indented by 1 level
  # The logical item to return should be 'card1' and not 'card' that seems rather a typo for 'card1'

  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    
    return card
  else:
    return card2


# Indentation is incorrect for a class function
# The 'total' object is not defined, and it should be as it's referenced in the for loop that follows
# Return statement: intendation shoud be at the same level as in the 'for' statement
# Return statement: trying to concatenate string and integer is not possible
    
def cards_total(self, cards):
  
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
```
